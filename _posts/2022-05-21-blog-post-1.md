Hi there! My name is Ram√≥n and I created a website to showcase my skills as a software engineer.

I am a Spanish tech enthusiast with a passion for learning and facing challenges. 
In my spare time, I do open-sourcing and practice sports in general.

I will post content about technology and other trendy topics.

Stay tuned!
